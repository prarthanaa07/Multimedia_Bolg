      Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire is a Telugu action-drama about the intense
      friendship between Deva (Prabhas) and Vardha (Prithviraj Sukumaran), set
      in the dystopian city-state of Khansaar, where Deva, a powerful tribesman,
      is called upon to help his childhood friend become the undisputed ruler
      amidst clan warfare and power struggles, leading to brutal action and
      bloodshed. Directed by Prashanth Neel (of KGF fame), the story explores
      themes of loyalty, destiny, and violence, establishing a vast world and a
      promise for more conflict in the sequel.
